# Mission-to-Mars
This project was designed to collect all relevant information about Mars in one place with the objective of having the information be updated on a regular basis without having to re-engineer the code.<br>
The resulting web page has been equipped with a button that will scrape data from Mars related websites and gather the most recent news, featured images as well as display the facts about Mars, all in one place.
